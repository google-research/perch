  """Taxonomy model for bird song classification.

  This model classifies the species of bird songs. It predicts multiple labels:
  whether a bird is detected, the species, genus, family, and order of the bird,
  and the nature of the background noise.

  Attributes:
    num_classes: Number of classes for each output head.
    encoder: A network (e.g., a 2D convolutional network) that takes
      spectrograms and returns feature vectors.
    taxonomy_loss_weight: Weight for taxonomic label losses.
    frontend: The frontend to use to generate features.
    hubert_feature_extractor: Optionally, a pre-trained frozen feature extractor
      trained in a self-supervised way. This option is mutually exclusive with
      frontend and is used for evaluation of self-supervised representations.
