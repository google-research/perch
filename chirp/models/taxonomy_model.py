  This model classifies the species of bird songs. It predicts multiple labels:

    num_classes: Number of classes for each output head.
    encoder: A network (e.g., a 2D convolutional network) that takes
      spectrograms and returns feature vectors.
    taxonomy_loss_weight: Weight for taxonomic label losses.
