  """Class Mean Average Precision metric.

  Accumulates logits and labels to allow computing MAP per-class across the
  full dataset. See the definition here:
  https://www.imageclef.org/BirdCLEF2019

  Caution: This implementation does not work in jit'ed functions, because
  concatenation of scores and labels has non-static shape. Workarounds for this
  exist, but are very ugly. Alternatively, a streaming approximation is
  possible, similar to the Keras implementation of AUC.

  Thus, it is recommended to compute CMAP metrics by accumulating scores
  and labels outside of the jit'ed loop.

  Attributes:
    scores: An array of logits or scores, with shape [batch, num_classes].
    labels: Array of ground-truth labels with shape [batch, num_classes].
