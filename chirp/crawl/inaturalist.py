  """Download all audio observations in iNaturalist.

  The regular API does not allow loading more than 10,000 observations and the
  export tool doesn't allow more than 200,000. Hence we use the export from
  iNaturalist that is submitted to GBIF. Note that this is a more limited set of
  recordings consisting of CC-BY, CC-BY-NC, and CC0 recordings which are
  "research-grade".

  Note that there are ~400,000 research-grade recordings of birds, but only
  ~300,000 of those have a CC-BY, CC-BY-NC or CC0 license according to the API.
  The majority (~80,000) of the others simply have no license attached.

  We use the iNaturalist export directly rather than going through GBIF because
  that export file is easier to download (even though it's bigger and needs to
  be filtered). This function assumes that `inaturalist.sh` has been run on the
  this file: http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/gbif-observations-dwca.zip.

  Args:
    input_file: A CSV file which contains a column called "identifier" with the
      URLs of files to download.
    output_dir: A writable directory in which the audio files will be stored.
