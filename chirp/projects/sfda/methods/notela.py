  """NOisy TEacher-student with Laplacian Adjustment (NOTELA), our method.

  It builds upon Dropout Student by incorporating a Laplacian regularization
  to the teacher step. NOTELA works in two different modes:
    - offline mode: Pseudo-labels are computed only once every epoch (before the
    epoch starts).
    - online mode: We track a memory of the dataset's extracted features and
    probabilities. Pseudo-labels are computed on-the-go by comparing samples
    from the current batch to the features/probabilities in memory.
  In both cases, the student-step remains to match the pseudo-labels using a
  noisy (dropout) model forward.
