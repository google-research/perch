    """Just like any standard nn.Module, defines the foward pass of the model.

    We formulate two non-standard requirements for the forward pass. First, it
    must disentangle the train/test behavior of BatchNorm layers and those of
    other noisy layers (e.g. Dropout). This is achieved through the use of
    'train' and 'use_running_average' options. Second, we require that the
    outputs are packaged into a output.ClassifierOutput, thereby including
    both the encoder's features, as well as the head's output. See
    chirp/projects/sfda/models/resnet.py for an example.

    Args:
      x: Batch of input images.
      train: Whether this is training. This affects noisy layers' behavior (e.g.
        Dropout). It also affects BatchNorm behavior in case
        'use_running_average' is set to None.
      use_running_average: Optional, used to decide whether to use running
        statistics in BatchNorm (test mode), or the current batch's statistics
        (train mode). If not specified (or specified to None), default to 'not
        train'.

    Returns:
      The model's outputs, packaged as a output.ClassifierOutput.
