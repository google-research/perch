"""Continuous wavelet transforms.

This module contains filters (Gabor, sinc) and wavelets (Morlet, Morse) that can
be used in a continuous wavelet transform.

Filtering can be done through convolution in the time-domain or by
multiplication in the frequency domain. Note that some filters are
non-differentiable in the frequency domain (sinc filters) whereas others don't
have an analytic representation in the time domain (Morse wavelets). Hence we
use both approaches.

Filters and wavelets can be normalized in different ways. Let φ(t) be the
time-domain filter and Φ(f) the frequency-domain filter. Different normalization
options are:

  * ∫|φ(t)| = 1 (L1 normalized, bandpass normalized)
  * ∫|φ(t)|² = ∫|Φ(t)|² = 1 (L2 normalized, energy normalized)
  * max |Φ(f)| = 1 (peak frequency response)

Note that max |Φ(f)| ≤ ∫|φ(t)|.

There are a variety of Fourier transform conventions. This code follows the
one from NumPy where the ordinary frequency is used: f̂(ω) = ∫f(t)exp(-i2πωt)dt.

For all parametrized filters we follow the approach of the continuous wavelet
transform (CWT) and learn a scale for each filter: φ(t/s) for s > 0. To keep the
function norm unchanged across scalings, we have to scale the values by 1/s (for
L1 normalization, time domain only) or 1/√s (for L2 normalization).

For reference implementations, see the Python package `ssqueezepy` and the
MATLAB package jLab.

  response is a Gaussian with mean sigma / 2π and standard deviation 1 / 2π[^1].

  For small values of sigma this filter has a non-zero response to non-positive
  frequencies. This means that it is not a wavelet (it fails the admissibility
  condition)[^2] and it is not analytic[^3].

  The zero-mean, shifted version of this filter is often called the (complex)
  Morlet wavelet, Gabor wavelet, or Gabor kernel. The Gabor filter is sometimes
  also referred to as the Gabor function[^4].

  normalization. Set sigma to the product of η and σ and then use σ as the
  scaling factor.
