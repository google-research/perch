  Attributes:
    compute_mfccs: If True, turn log-melspectrograms into MFCCs.
    num_mfccs: How many MFCCs to keep. Unused if compute_mfccs is False.
    aggregation: How to aggregate over time. If 'beans', we concatenate the
      mean, standard deviation, min, and max over the time axis (which mirrors
      the processing done in the BEANS benchmark (Hagiwara et al., 2022)). If
      'avg_pool', we perform average pooling over the time axis (controlled by
      `window_size` and `window_stride`) before flattening the time and channel
      axes. If `flatten`, we simply flatten the time and channel axes.
    window_size: Average pooling window size. Unused if `aggregation` is not
      `avg_pool`.
    window_stride: Average pooling window stride. Unused if `aggregation` is not
      `avg_pool`.
