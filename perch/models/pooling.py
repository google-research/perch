  """Pools using a window function.

  Note that is not a pooling function in the traditional sense, i.e., it does
  not use a reduction operator applied to the elements in each window. Instead,
  a weighted average is taken over the window. If the weighting is given by a
  parametrized window, e.g., a Gaussian, then these parameters are learned. This
  allows the model to interpolate between subsampling (a Gaussian with zero
  variance) and average pooling (a Gaussian with infinite variance).

  When using a Gaussian window, there are a few differences with the
  implementation in LEAF[^1]. Firstly, this module by default scales the weights
  to sum to unity. This ensure that the energy of the output signal is the same
  as the input. Secondly, this module does not perform clipping on the window
  parameters. This is expected to be done during optimization.

  Attributes:
    window: The window function to use. Should follow the conventions of the
      `scipy.signal.windows` functions.
    window_size: The size of the pooling window.
    window_init: Initializer of the window parameters. It should take as an
      argument an RNG key, the number of filters, and the width of the window,
      and return a tuple of parameters. Each parameter should have the number of
      filters as its first axis.
    normalize_window: Whether or not to normalize the window to sum to 1.
    stride: The stride to use.
    padding: Padding to use.
